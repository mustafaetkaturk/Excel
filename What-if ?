In this question, it gave me an accounting challenge. It is a very neatly formulated table to calculate profit for a given number of sold products.
However, the question is in reverse and asking how many should be the number to be equal to a profit of $10,000. 

Least evolved version of the solution is that doing an educated guess to find a closest number and then, trying the numbers one by one to get closer to answer.
This is far from ideal because technology is there for you to get faster easily.

I mean, Excel has a declarative tool called "What-If Analysis" under Data Tab. With this tool, you can create scenarios, multiple input actions or goal seek
For our question, we need to use goal seek. Goal seek will try the numbers automatically to find out the exact number to a decimal point. 

Click on Goal Seek, 
Set Cell          : C15     // Cell of Calculation of Profit
To Value          : 10000   // Calculation of Profit should be $10,000
By Changing Cell  : C11     // Cell of Number of Sold Products 

Quickly, we learn that we need to sell ~2906 (2906.30086026506) products to acquire profit of $10,000.
