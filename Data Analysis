I have never used pivot table till now. Mainly, I do not like to work in Excel when I try to do analysis but excel is the cheapest tool to practice.
I wish I'd know more when I was in high school. University would have been easier. 

In this task, it asks us to Show by quarter - the quality sold, total sales, and avg sale price for the given data

Choose all of the table given and go to Insert Tab and click on Pivot table. Choose output cell in existing worksheet.
On the right side, click and slide Date field into Rows*. Then you will see under the section "Rows", Quarter, Year and Date will appear. Exclude Date now.
Then click on "Purchase" field and slide into the section Values 3 times then click on the down arrow of those purchase fields under the Values Section to
correct the details to be average, count and sum as it is requested. 

One important detail is that the higher in the section list a field goes, the earlier it will be presented in pivot table. Meaning Quarters can be represented
before years or the order of columns can be changed. 

*If data in "Date" column are not recognized as a date. You might need to align the format. Otherwise, you will not be successful
