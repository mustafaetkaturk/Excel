In this one, I was working on an basic 13 by 2 table.

Instruction was to use 2 different formulas to find the office location of any given employee.

1st column was called Employees and 2nd column was called office location. So, Instruction wanted me to check first column for a match,
and return corresponding data in the second column. It was basically a vertical look-up.

In the first one I took the high road and used Match() formula to return the relative position of any given employee in a chosen table.
So, I chose only the employee column and get the relative row number of any given employee. Then, I used Index() formula to return the 
corresponding value in the chosen column, which is office location column. 

=INDEX(C6:C18,MATCH(F6,B6:B18,0))	

In the second one, I used VLOOKUP() formula. This is the easy one since we have established that It was basically a vertical look-up.

=VLOOKUP(F11,B6:C18,2,FALSE)
