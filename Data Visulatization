In this one, we have been honored with and income statement and instucted to create a chart showing product and service revenue and gross margin percentage.
This is a basic data visualization challenge. However, Devil is in the detail. Which data to choose, which chart type to insert, What should be the title of 
the Chart, is this color connect the audience and so on. These are important matters to know. 

In this one, Data to choose is Product and Service under the revenue and gross margin percentage at the end of the table. Chart type to choose is combo chart
with Clustered Column - Line on Secondary Axis. This way we can see each data clearly and compare it visually to see what's happening. And then title the chart 
as "Product and Service Revenue and Gross Margin %". Choose the colors with the best contrast. 

PS. This will make more sense if you work on your game to convince people with data.
