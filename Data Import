Instructions says Clean the raw data import and identify sales less than $300. And this is the given raw data:

Squid Ward 1001 Honolulu Hawaii 301
Sponge Bob 1002 Honolulu Hawaii 238
Homer Simp 1003 Austin Texas 294
Elon Musk 1004 Austin Texas 238
Steve Jobs 1005 Irvine California 294
Warren Buffet 1006 Chicago Illinois 308
Charlie Munger 1007 Chicago Illinois 339.5
Kevin Hart 1008 Philadelphia Pennsylvania 332.5
Barrack Obama 1009 Tysons Virginia 318.5
Bob Builder 1010 Tampa Florida 273
Tom Hanks 1011 Miami Florida 252
Michael Jordan 1012 Cleveland Ohio 346.5
Thierry Henry 1013 Seattle Washington 339
Eden Hazard 1014 Seattle Washington 308
Andrea Pirlo 1016 Tysons Virginia 252

The idea is that raw data needs to be transformed into table with the column names First Name, Last Name, ID Number, City, State and Sales Amount.
This is another declarative tool of Excel. Many of the people who worked with CSV files would know this tool. This tool help you to translate raw data 
into an excel table. 

In this example, we choose the raw data; which should be in one non-merged column, and go to Data Tab and click on "Text to Columns". Choose Delimited,
and go next. Then, as a delimeter we choose space then go next and choose where the end result should appear. Viola... Now we have our table and need to
identify the sales amount with conditional formatting under Home Tab. 

PS. I found this problem highly limited since we are dealing with people only with one first name and one last name or cities or states with one word.
It could've been in the format like this:

Squid,Emmanuel,Ward,1001,Honolulu,Hawaii,301
Sponge,,Bob,1002,Honolulu,Hawaii,238

PSS. Also, instead of asking identifying/conditionally formatting the sales only but all row with other data would have been better.
